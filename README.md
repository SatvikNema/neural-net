# neural-net

This repository implements a neural network using 2d arrays and math in pure java. No other frameworks and libraries used.

You've come to the right place if :
 - you're new to ML 
 - fed up with those heavily abstracted libraries like scikit learn, tensorflow, numpy (yes i'll consider numpy as abstracted!)
 - want to understand how [these](https://brilliant.org/wiki/backpropagation/) math formulas are translated to code
 - aaaand want to see it all in java (cause why not)

There are a series of medium blogs which take you through the implementation.
